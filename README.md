## About The Project

This project is a guided webinar included in **ServiceNow Knowledge 2021**

- Session ID: CCL1047
- Session Level:  Basic

In this CreatorCon lab you will learn how to use UI Builder (UIB) to work on a Configurable Workspace experience to suit the business needs of your custom application. The custom app used for this lab is a simple Blogging application which allows managing posts, comments, and likes. CCL1088 covers configuring the portal experience with UI Builder, this lab covers the workspace side of things. Both labs can be done independently, as they're not based off of each other, but we highly recommend you do both to get a more comprehensive picture of the functionality offered in UIB.

UI Builder concepts covered in this lab include:

- Theming your workspace
- Customizing a landing page
- Adding page variants for different audiences
- Add data visualization components
- Embed a playbook component as a related item and in the Contextual sidebar
- Make a UI Action available on the record form in workspace

**Application/Capabilities:**

- Now Experience

**Target Personas:**

- Beginning ServiceNow Developer
- Builder
- ServiceNow Store Developer
